# Brainstorming Session Results

## Executive Summary

*   **Session Topic:** A color picker tool for designers to showcase the BMad development method.
*   **Goals:** Maximize functionality while creating a useful tool and keeping documentation updated.
*   **Techniques Used:** Rapid Ideation, Analyst-led Ideation, Feature Prioritization.
*   **Total Ideas Generated:** 10+
*   **Key Themes:** Core color selection, advanced generation (palettes/gradients), accessibility, and workflow (history/export).

## Idea Categorization & Action Plan

The features were categorized into a phased release plan.

### Version 1.0: Must-Have Core Features

This version will focus on delivering a simple, complete, and useful workflow.

*   **Core Color Selection:**
    *   **Eyedropper Tool:** Select a color from anywhere on the screen.
    *   **Manual Inputs:** Manually enter color values (HEX, RGB, HSL).
*   **Simple Color History:** A temporary list of recently used colors, stored in the browser's local storage.
*   **Basic Export:** The ability to copy a single color's value (e.g., HEX code) to the clipboard.

### Version 1.1: Nice-to-Have Features

These features will be implemented after the core V1 is complete.

*   **Color Palette Generator:** Automatically create harmonious color palettes.
*   **Gradient Generator:** Create multi-color linear and radial gradients.
*   **Full Accessibility Toolkit:**
    *   **Contrast Checker:** Check WCAG contrast ratios.
    *   **Color Blindness Simulator:** Preview palettes for different vision types.
*   **Advanced Export Options:**
    *   Export palettes as CSS/SASS code.
    *   Save palettes as PNG image files.

### Future Ideas (Scoped Out)

*   **Permanent Saved Palettes:** A feature to save and name palettes was deemed out of scope for this sample project.
*   **Community Palettes:** A complex feature to be considered for a much later version.

## Next Steps

*   Develop the Version 1.0 features.
*   Update `README.md` to reflect the project plan.
