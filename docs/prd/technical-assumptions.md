# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

A monorepo structure is chosen to simplify setup and dependency management for this small-scale project.

## Service Architecture

Client-Side Application. All logic will be contained within the frontend application. No backend services are required for the MVP.

## Testing Requirements

Unit and Integration tests are required. Given the visual and interactive nature of the tool, End-to-End (E2E) tests for core user flows are highly recommended.
