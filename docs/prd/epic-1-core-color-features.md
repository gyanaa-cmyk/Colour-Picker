# Epic 1: Core Color Features - Initial Development

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational color input, processing, and scheme generation capabilities that enable users to input colors through multiple formats and generate color palettes using proven color theory algorithms.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: New project - no existing functionality
- Technology stack: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, culori color engine
- Integration points: Browser EyeDropper API, Canvas 2D API, state management with Zustand

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added: Core color input system with HEX/RGB/HSL support, EyeDropper tool, and color scheme generation (complementary, analogous, monochromatic, split-complement, triadic, square)
- How it integrates: Uses culori for color space conversions, Zustand for state management, browser APIs for color picking
- Success criteria: Users can input colors via text or eyedropper, see immediate previews, and generate color schemes based on color theory

## Stories

List of focused stories that complete the epic:

1. **Story 1.1:** Color Input Foundation - Multi-format color input (HEX, RGB, HSL) with validation and EyeDropper tool integration
2. **Story 1.2:** Color Scheme Generation - Implement complementary, analogous, monochromatic, split-complement, triadic, and square color schemes using OKLCH hue rotation
3. **Story 1.3:** Gradient Builder Foundation - Generate linear and radial gradients with 2-5 stops using perceptually spaced OKLCH interpolation
4. **Story 1.4:** Basic Export System - Export palettes and gradients to SVG, PNG, CSS variables, and JSON with copy-to-clipboard functionality

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Browser API compatibility (EyeDropper with graceful fallback)
- ✅ Cross-browser color space support with culori library
- ✅ Responsive design patterns using Tailwind CSS
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ Performance considerations for real-time color processing

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Color accuracy and gamut handling across different color spaces
- **Mitigation:** Use proven culori library for color conversions, implement gamut clamping and validation
- **Rollback Plan:** Each story builds incrementally - can revert to previous working state at story boundaries

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories (1.1-1.4) completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Core color workflows functioning: input → preview → scheme generation → basic export
- ✅ EyeDropper integration working with fallback for unsupported browsers
- ✅ Color accuracy validated across different input formats
- ✅ Basic performance benchmarks met (sub-100ms color processing)
- ✅ Component architecture established for future feature expansion

## Priority & Sequencing

- **Priority**: P0 (Critical) - Foundation for all other features
- **Estimated Duration**: 4-6 development cycles (1 story per cycle)
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational epic)
- **Enables**: All subsequent epics depend on this foundation

## Success Metrics

- Users can successfully input colors in any supported format
- Color scheme generation produces accurate, visually appealing results
- EyeDropper tool works reliably in supported browsers with graceful fallback
- Export functionality produces correct format outputs
- Component architecture supports extension for future features

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"This epic establishes the core foundation for ColorSmith. Key considerations:

- This is initial development for a new React 18 + TypeScript application
- Integration points: Browser EyeDropper API, culori color engine, Zustand state management
- Critical patterns to establish: Component architecture, state management patterns, color processing workflows
- Each story must include comprehensive testing to ensure color accuracy and reliability

The epic should deliver a solid foundation that enables all advanced features while maintaining excellent performance and user experience."
