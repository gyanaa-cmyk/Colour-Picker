# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Deliver a functional, high-quality Colour Picker tool that provides a streamlined workflow for digital designers.
*   Successfully demonstrate the BMad development method by building a useful application from concept to completion.
*   Achieve positive user feedback and initial adoption from a target group of designers.

## Background Context

Based on the approved Project Brief, this document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Colour Picker tool. The project aims to solve the problem of workflow fragmentation for designers who currently use multiple tools for color selection, palette management, and accessibility checking. By consolidating these features into a single, intuitive web application, we intend to save designers time and improve their creative process.

This PRD focuses exclusively on the V1.0 features identified in the brief. The core objective is to build a simple, stable, and useful tool that provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
