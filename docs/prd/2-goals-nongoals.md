# 2. Goals & Non‑Goals

## **Goals**

1. **Deliver a functional color-generation engine** supporting all six primary schemes (complementary, analogous, monochromatic, split-complement, triadic, square).
2. **Produce perceptually balanced gradients** (linear + radial) with configurable stop counts and OKLCH interpolation.
3. **Offer frictionless UX** — single-input workflow, instant results, one-click copy/export.
4. **Enable developer-ready outputs** (CSS vars, Tailwind snippet, JSON palette, SVG/PNG assets).
5. **Maintain accessibility parity** — WCAG 2.2 AA + APCA pass/fail for all palette pairs.
6. **Perform fully offline in browser** (no server round-trips).
7. **Ship as a responsive PWA** with local palette history and shareable URLs.

## **Non-Goals (MVP)**

* Authentication, user accounts, or cloud sync.
* Batch palette generation or multi-seed comparison.
* Figma/VS Code/Browser-extension integrations.
* Advanced color-blind simulation or brand-token automation (Phase 2).
* Paid subscription flows or monetization mechanics.
