# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be clean, intuitive, and extremely fast. As a tool for designers, the UI itself must be aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive. The goal is a "tool-like" feel, prioritizing function and speed over ornamentation.

## Core Screens and Views

*   **Main View:** A single-page application view that contains all the core components: the color preview, manual input fields, eyedropper button, color history, and export options.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application itself must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to be a credible tool for creating accessible designs.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The primary target is desktop web browsers, but the layout should be responsive enough to be usable on tablet-sized screens.
