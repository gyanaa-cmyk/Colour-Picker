## **Jobs to be Done**

1. “When designing a new interface, I want to input one brand color and get matching palette ideas so I can iterate faster.”
2. “When implementing design tokens, I want one-click exports for CSS/Tailwind so I can stay in flow.”
3. “When checking color accessibility, I want automatic contrast results so I can fix issues early.”
