# Template and Framework Selection

Based on the PRD (Story 1.1) and modern web standards, this project will be initialized using **Vite with the React + TypeScript template**. This provides a fast development server, optimized builds, and out-of-the-box TypeScript support, which is superior to the older `create-react-app`.
