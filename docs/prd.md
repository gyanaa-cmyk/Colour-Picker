# Colour Picker Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Deliver a functional, high-quality Colour Picker tool that provides a streamlined workflow for digital designers.
*   Successfully demonstrate the BMad development method by building a useful application from concept to completion.
*   Achieve positive user feedback and initial adoption from a target group of designers.

### Background Context

Based on the approved Project Brief, this document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Colour Picker tool. The project aims to solve the problem of workflow fragmentation for designers who currently use multiple tools for color selection, palette management, and accessibility checking. By consolidating these features into a single, intuitive web application, we intend to save designers time and improve their creative process.

This PRD focuses exclusively on the V1.0 features identified in the brief. The core objective is to build a simple, stable, and useful tool that provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## Requirements

### Functional

1.  **FR1:** The system must provide an eyedropper tool that allows a user to select a color from any point on their screen.
2.  **FR2:** The system must allow a user to manually input color values in HEX, RGB, and HSL formats.
3.  **FR3:** The system must display a history of recently selected colors.
4.  **FR4:** The system must allow a user to copy a selected color's value to their clipboard in HEX format.

### Non Functional

1.  **NFR1:** The application must be a client-side web application; no backend or database is required for the MVP.
2.  **NFR2:** The color history must be persisted for the user session using the browser's local storage.
3.  **NFR3:** The application must be responsive and usable on modern desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
4.  **NFR4:** The eyedropper tool must be performant and not introduce significant lag or resource consumption.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be clean, intuitive, and extremely fast. As a tool for designers, the UI itself must be aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive. The goal is a "tool-like" feel, prioritizing function and speed over ornamentation.

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Main View:** A single-page application view that contains all the core components: the color preview, manual input fields, eyedropper button, color history, and export options.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application itself must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to be a credible tool for creating accessible designs.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The primary target is desktop web browsers, but the layout should be responsive enough to be usable on tablet-sized screens.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

A monorepo structure is chosen to simplify setup and dependency management for this small-scale project.

### Service Architecture

Client-Side Application. All logic will be contained within the frontend application. No backend services are required for the MVP.

### Testing Requirements

Unit and Integration tests are required. Given the visual and interactive nature of the tool, End-to-End (E2E) tests for core user flows are highly recommended.

## Epic List

For the MVP, all work will be contained within a single epic to deliver a complete, valuable increment of functionality.

*   **Epic 1: Core Colour Picker MVP:** Establish the project foundation and deliver a functional tool for selecting, viewing, and exporting colors.

## Epic 1: Core Colour Picker MVP

**Goal:** To create a fully functional, client-side color picker application that allows a user to select colors via an eyedropper or manual input, view recent colors in a history panel, and copy a color's HEX code to their clipboard.

### Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

As a developer,
I want a new frontend project initialized with a modern framework (React), linting, and a basic application shell,
so that I can begin developing features in a clean and structured codebase.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new React application is created using `create-react-app` or a similar tool.
2.  ESLint and Prettier are configured for code quality and consistency.
3.  A basic `App` component is rendered that displays a "Colour Picker" heading.
4.  The project is checked into a new Git repository.

### Story 1.2: Manual Color Input & Preview

As a designer,
I want to be able to type a HEX, RGB, or HSL color code into an input field and see a preview of that color,
so that I can work with specific colors I already have.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  UI components for HEX, RGB, and HSL input are present.
2.  A color swatch component displays the color represented by the inputs.
3.  Changing the value in any input field updates the color swatch and the other corresponding input values.
4.  Invalid input is handled gracefully (e.g., swatch shows a default color, input field has a visual error indicator).

### Story 1.3: Eyedropper Implementation

As a designer,
I want a button that activates a screen-wide eyedropper tool,
so that I can pick a color from anywhere on my desktop.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  An "Activate Eyedropper" button is present in the UI.
2.  Clicking the button activates a native or library-based screen color picker.
3.  Selecting a color with the eyedropper updates the color swatch and the manual input fields with the selected color's values.
4.  Cancelling the eyedropper action returns the application to its previous state without error.

### Story 1.4: Color History Panel

As a designer,
I want to see a list of my recently selected colors,
so that I can easily re-select or compare them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Every time a new color is selected (either via manual input or eyedropper), it is added to the top of a "History" list.
2.  The history list displays a swatch of each color.
3.  The history list is persisted in the browser's local storage.
4.  Clicking on a color in the history list updates the main color preview and inputs to that color.

### Story 1.5: Basic Clipboard Export

As a designer,
I want to be able to quickly copy the HEX code of my currently selected color,
so that I can paste it into my design tool or codebase.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A "Copy HEX" button is present next to the HEX input field.
2.  Clicking the button copies the current HEX value to the user's clipboard.
3.  A visual confirmation (e.g., the button text temporarily changes to "Copied!") is shown to the user upon a successful copy action.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

"Please review the attached PRD for the Colour Picker tool. Based on the defined UI/UX goals, please propose a high-level wireframe or component layout for the 'Main View' that is clean, intuitive, and efficient for a designer's workflow."

### Architect Prompt

"Please review the attached PRD, specifically the requirements, technical assumptions, and user stories. Propose a technical architecture and implementation plan for the V1.0 React application. Your plan should include choices for key libraries (e.g., for the eyedropper), a component breakdown, and a state management strategy."
