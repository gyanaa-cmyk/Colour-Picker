story: 1.2-scheme-generation
status: PASS
date: 2025-10-04
reviewer: QA Agent (automated)
rationale: |
  All acceptance criteria, NFRs, and testability requirements are met. Algorithms are robust, tests cover all schemes and edge cases, and UI disables generation if seed is missing. Minor act() warnings in unrelated tests are non-blocking. No blocking issues found.
