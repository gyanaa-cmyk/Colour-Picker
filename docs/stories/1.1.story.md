# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

**As a developer,**
I want a new frontend project initialized with a modern framework (React), linting, and a basic application shell,
**so that** I can begin developing features in a clean and structured codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new React application is created using Vite with the React + TypeScript template.
2.  ESLint and Prettier are configured for code quality and consistency.
3.  A basic `App` component is rendered that displays a "Colour Picker" heading.
4.  The project is checked into a new Git repository.

## Dev Notes

### Framework & Build Tool

- The project MUST be initialized using **Vite** with the `React + TypeScript` template. This is a deviation from the original story which mentioned `create-react-app`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/template-and-framework-selection.md]
- The development server should be started with `npm run dev`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

### Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **State Management:** Zustand (to be added in a later story)
- **Styling:** Styled-components (to be added in a later story)
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure

- The initial project structure should be created as defined in the architecture. The main application entry point will be `/src/main.tsx` and the root component will be `/src/App.tsx`.
- The following directories should be created:
  - `/src/components/common`
  - `/src/components/layout`
  - `/src/features/color-picker`
  - `/src/features/color-history`
  - `/src/hooks`
  - `/src/store`
  - `/src/styles`
  [Source: docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md]

### Developer Standards & Linting

- ESLint and Prettier should be configured to enforce the rules outlined in the developer standards.
- All components must be functional components using React Hooks.
- Props must be typed using TypeScript interfaces.
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

### Testing

- Vitest and React Testing Library should be installed and configured.
- A sample component test should be created to ensure the test runner is working.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Initialize Project:**
    - Run `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts` to scaffold a new React + TypeScript project in the current directory.
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - Install `eslint` and `prettier` along with necessary plugins (`eslint-plugin-react`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, etc.).
    - Install `styled-components`.
    - Install `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`.
3.  **Configure Tooling:**
    - Create `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, and `vite.config.ts` files.
    - Configure ESLint rules to align with `frontend-developer-standards.md`.
    - Configure Vite to use the React plugin.
4.  **Create Initial Structure:**
    - Create the directory structure as specified in `docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md`.
    - Create a basic `App.tsx` component that renders an `<h1>` with the text "Colour Picker".
    - Update `main.tsx` to render the `App` component.
5.  **Setup Git:**
    - Initialize a new Git repository.
    - Create a `.gitignore` file.
    - Add all project files and make the initial commit. (AC: 4)
6.  **Verification:**
    - Run `npm run dev` to ensure the application starts and displays the heading. (AC: 3)
    - Run `npm run test` to ensure the test runner is configured and can execute a sample test.
