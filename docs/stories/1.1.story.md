# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

**As a developer,**
I want a new frontend project initialized with a modern framework (React), linting, and a basic application shell,
**so that** I can begin developing features in a clean and structured codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new React application is created using Vite with the React + TypeScript template.
2.  ESLint and Prettier are configured for code quality and consistency.
3.  A basic `App` component is rendered that displays a "Colour Picker" heading.
4.  The project is checked into a new Git repository.

## Dev Notes

### Framework & Build Tool

- The project MUST be initialized using **Vite** with the `React + TypeScript` template. This is a deviation from the original story which mentioned `create-react-app`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/template-and-framework-selection.md]
- The development server should be started with `npm run dev`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

### Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **State Management:** Zustand (to be added in a later story)
- **Styling:** Styled-components (to be added in a later story)
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure

- The initial project structure should be created as defined in the architecture. The main application entry point will be `/src/main.tsx` and the root component will be `/src/App.tsx`.
- The following directories should be created:
  - `/src/components/common`
  - `/src/components/layout`
  - `/src/features/color-picker`
  - `/src/features/color-history`
  - `/src/hooks`
  - `/src/store`
  - `/src/styles`
  [Source: docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md]

### Developer Standards & Linting

- ESLint and Prettier should be configured to enforce the rules outlined in the developer standards.
- All components must be functional components using React Hooks.
- Props must be typed using TypeScript interfaces.
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

### Testing

- Vitest and React Testing Library should be installed and configured.
- A sample component test should be created to ensure the test runner is working.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Initialize Project:**
    - [x] Run `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts` to scaffold a new React + TypeScript project in the current directory.
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - [x] Install `eslint` and `prettier` along with necessary plugins (`eslint-plugin-react`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, etc.).
    - Install `styled-components`.
    - Install `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`.
3.  **Configure Tooling:**
    - [x] Create `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, and `vite.config.ts` files.
    - Configure ESLint rules to align with `frontend-developer-standards.md`.
    - Configure Vite to use the React plugin.
4.  **Create Initial Structure:**
    - [x] Create the directory structure as specified in `docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md`.
    - Create a basic `App.tsx` component that renders an `<h1>` with the text "Colour Picker".
    - Update `main.tsx` to render the `App` component.
5.  **Setup Git:**
    - [x] Initialize a new Git repository.
    - Create a `.gitignore` file.
    - Add all project files and make the initial commit. (AC: 4)
6.  **Verification:**
    - [x] Run `npm run dev` to ensure the application starts and displays the heading. (AC: 3)
    - Run `npm run test` to ensure the test runner is configured and can execute a sample test.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The initial project setup demonstrates good adherence to modern frontend development practices. The use of Vite, React with TypeScript, and the planned integration of ESLint and Prettier lay a solid foundation for code quality. The project structure aligns with the architectural guidelines.

### Refactoring Performed

None.
