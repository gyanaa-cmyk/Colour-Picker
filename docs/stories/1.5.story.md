# Story 1.5: Basic Clipboard Export

**As a designer,**
I want to be able to quickly copy the HEX code of my currently selected color,
**so that** I can paste it into my design tool or codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "Copy HEX" button is present next to the HEX input field.
2.  Clicking the button copies the current HEX value to the user's clipboard.
3.  A visual confirmation (e.g., the button text temporarily changes to "Copied!") is shown to the user upon a successful copy action.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.2 "Manual Color Input & Preview" is in Draft status.
- Story 1.3 "Eyedropper Implementation" is in Draft status.
- Story 1.4 "Color History Panel" is in Draft status.
- Project initialized with Vite and React/TypeScript in `frontend/` directory.
- ESLint and Prettier configured.
- Basic `App.tsx` component rendering "Colour Picker" heading.
- Git repository updated with frontend files.

### Component Specifications
- Components should follow `PascalCase` naming convention. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/component-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- Props must be typed using TypeScript interfaces. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- Use `styled-components` for component-level styling. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/styling-guidelines.md#styling-approach]
- A `Button.tsx` common component is suggested in the project structure, located in `src/components/common`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md]
- The HEX input field will be part of the `ColorInputs` component from Story 1.2.

### State Management
- Zustand is chosen for global state management. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- The `useColorStore` is the suggested store for color state, located in `src/store/useColorStore.ts`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/state-management.md#store-structure]
- The `activeColor` from `useColorStore` will provide the current color's HEX value.

### File Locations
- The "Copy HEX" button will likely be integrated into the `ColorInputs` component in `src/features/color-picker`.
- Common components like `Button.tsx` should be in `src/components/common`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md]
- A custom hook `useCopyToClipboard.ts` is suggested in the project structure, located in `src/hooks`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md]

### Testing
- Use Vitest and React Testing Library for testing. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Component tests should follow the provided template. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md#component-test-template-vitest-react-testing-library]

### Technical Constraints
- All components must be functional components using React Hooks. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- No business logic should reside directly in JSX; extract it to handlers or hooks. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]

### Styling
- Global theme variables are defined in `src/styles/theme.ts`. [Source: docs/ui-architecture/styling-guidelines.md#global-theme-variables]

### Clipboard API
- The browser's `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API should be used for copying to the clipboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Create `useCopyToClipboard` Hook (AC: 2)**
    - [ ] Create `src/hooks/useCopyToClipboard.ts`.
    - [ ] This hook should provide a function to copy text to the clipboard and manage a "copied" state for visual feedback.
    - [ ] Utilize `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`.
2.  **Integrate "Copy HEX" Button (AC: 1, 2, 3)**
    - [ ] Modify `src/features/color-picker/ColorInputs.tsx` (from Story 1.2) to include a "Copy HEX" button next to the HEX input field.
    - [ ] Use the common `Button` component.
    - [ ] On button click, get the current HEX value from `useColorStore`'s `activeColor`.
    - [ ] Use the `useCopyToClipboard` hook to copy the HEX value to the clipboard.
    - [ ] Implement visual confirmation (e.g., button text changes to "Copied!" temporarily) using the state from `useCopyToClipboard`.
3.  **Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for `useCopyToClipboard.ts` to verify clipboard functionality and state management.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for `ColorInputs.tsx` to ensure the "Copy HEX" button correctly copies the HEX value and displays visual feedback.
