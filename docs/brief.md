# Project Brief: AI-Powered Colour Picker

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the project brief for a new Colour Picker tool designed for web and UI designers. The primary problem is the fragmented workflow designers face, often using multiple tools for color inspiration, palette generation, and accessibility checking. Our proposed solution is an all-in-one web-based tool that consolidates these functions into a single, efficient interface. The target market is professional and hobbyist digital designers who require a fast, powerful, and accessible color management workflow. The key value proposition is to streamline the creative process by providing palette generation, gradient creation, and accessibility compliance checks in one place.

## Problem Statement

Digital designers currently rely on a disjointed set of tools to manage colors. A typical workflow might involve using a browser extension to pick a color, a separate web app to generate a palette, another tool to create gradients, and yet another to check for WCAG accessibility compliance. This fragmentation leads to context switching, inefficiency, and a higher chance of errors. Existing solutions often excel in one area but lack a holistic feature set, forcing users to piece together their own toolkit. The urgency is driven by the increasing demand for accessible and sophisticated design systems, which makes an integrated tool more critical than ever.

## Proposed Solution

We will develop a comprehensive, web-based Colour Picker application. The core concept is to provide a seamless workflow from color discovery to export. Key differentiators will include an integrated accessibility toolkit and a powerful gradient generator alongside standard palette creation tools. The vision is for this tool to become an indispensable part of a designer's daily workflow by being the fastest and most intuitive way to manage every aspect of a project's color system.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Digital Designers

*   **Profile:** Professional and hobbyist web designers, UI/UX designers, and front-end developers who are responsible for creating and implementing color schemes.
*   **Behaviors:** They work in fast-paced environments, often juggling multiple projects. They are comfortable with design software and browser-based tools.
*   **Needs & Pains:** They need to work quickly, ensure brand consistency, meet accessibility standards, and find creative inspiration. Their primary pain is the time wasted switching between multiple single-purpose color tools.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
*   Successfully build and launch Version 1.0 of the Colour Picker tool to serve as a functional proof-of-concept for the BMad development method.
*   Create a tool that is genuinely useful and adopted by a small group of initial users.

### User Success Metrics
*   Users can complete the entire workflow (pick color, create palette, check accessibility, export) within the application.
*   Positive qualitative feedback from users regarding the tool's efficiency and usefulness.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who successfully perform a core workflow.
*   **User Satisfaction:** Measured via a simple feedback form after a set number of uses.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
*   **Core Colour Selection:** Includes both an Eyedropper Tool to pick from the screen and Manual Inputs for HEX/RGB/HSL values. This provides the basic utility for color identification.
*   **Simple Colour History:** A temporary list of recently used colours, stored in the browser's local storage for session continuity.
*   **Basic Export:** The ability to copy a single colour's value (e.g., HEX code) to the clipboard, making the tool immediately useful.

### Out of Scope for MVP
*   Permanent user accounts and saved palettes.
*   Community-based features (e.g., browsing others' palettes).
*   Advanced palette generation (triadic, analogous, etc.).
*   Advanced gradient controls.
*   Saving palettes as image files.

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP will be considered successful if a user can easily select a color using either the eyedropper or manual input, see that color in their history, and copy its value to their clipboard without errors or confusion.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
*   **Color Palette Generator:** Automatically create harmonious color palettes.
*   **Gradient Generator:** Create multi-color linear and radial gradients.
*   **Full Accessibility Toolkit:** Contrast Checker and Color Blindness Simulator.
*   **Advanced Export Options:** Export palettes as CSS/SASS code and PNG images.

### Long-term Vision
In 1-2 years, the tool could evolve into a full-fledged design system management platform, incorporating fonts, spacing, and other design tokens, potentially with team collaboration features.

## Technical Considerations

_(Note: These are initial thoughts and not final decisions)_

### Platform Requirements
*   **Target Platforms:** Modern desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Performance Requirements:** The eyedropper tool must be responsive and have minimal performance impact on the user's system.

### Technology Preferences
*   **Frontend:** React or Vue.js for a component-based architecture.
*   **Backend:** A simple Node.js (Express) backend may be needed for future features, but V1 could be purely client-side.
*   **Database:** None required for V1. Browser local storage will suffice.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
*   **Scope:** The project is a sample to demonstrate a development method; features are strictly limited to the defined MVP.
*   **Storage:** No server-side storage or user accounts will be implemented. All state is temporary and local.

### Key Assumptions
*   We assume designers are willing to use a new, standalone web tool if it is significantly more efficient than their current workflow.
*   We assume that a purely client-side application is sufficient for the MVP and V1.1 features.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
*   **Technical Complexity:** The screen-wide eyedropper functionality can be complex to implement reliably and cross-browser.
*   **User Adoption:** The market has many existing tools; differentiation will be key to adoption.

### Open Questions
*   What is the single most important "advanced" feature for designers after the basics are covered?
*   How critical is mobile support for a tool like this?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1.  Review and approve this Project Brief.
2.  Proceed to create a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on this brief.
3.  Begin technical design and prototyping for the V1.0 features.

### PM Handoff
This Project Brief provides the full context for the Colour Picker tool. The next step is to engage a Product Manager (PM) to begin the PRD generation process, using this brief as the foundational input.
